# A Simple Flask API with MySQL

This is a simple Flask application with SQLAlchemy and other's library. Just checkout the requirements.txt for more details.

To run it, simply enable your own virtual environment and install all the library from requirements.txt with command pip install -r requirements.txt, run FLASK_APP=app.py flask run and run it as a localhost in your POSTMAN, or curl in your terminal, if you are using Linux or Mac, or command prompt if you are using Windows.

Note: make sure you have MySQL on your machine, and either in MySQL Workbench or MySQL CLI, create the database first. I am still searching the way on how to create the database automatically, upon running the Flask app.
